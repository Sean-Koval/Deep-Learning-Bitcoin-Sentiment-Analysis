1) Create the .py file, Dockerfile, and requirments.txt file
2) Build the docker image locally to test
3) Run the docker image locally (make sure you have IAM role permissions attached to instance: edit the ~/.aws/config file)
4) Ping the endpoint to see if it worked

docker build -t app:latest .

# run command
# only need this stuff for local (dont need to pass -v or -p)
docker run -p 9000:8080 -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws app:latest
